# burger

An "Eat Da Burger!" application using Node.js, Express, MySql, Handlebars, and Bootstrap.

<h2>Description</h2>

This is a simple full stack application to demonstrate how to access a MySql database, adding and updating entries,  based on user-input from the web browser.

<h2>Usage</h2>
The application displays the current content of the burger database to the user filtered by whether the burger has been eaten already.  An uneaten burger can be devoured by clicking the "Devour Me!" button.  This updates the status of the burger in the database and moves the burger from the uneaten column to the eaten column.  New burgers can be added at the bottom of the screen by typing in a name, selecting whether it has been eaten already, and clicking the "Add Burger" button.
